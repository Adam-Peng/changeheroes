# Instructions

1. Build an address book using the attached wireframe. All contacts should be listed on the left had side, be searchable, and can be toggled to view their full details in the main view.

2. Contacts should be editable in the main view.

3. Make sure to use filters, binding, and some of Angular's built in directives.

4. Replace this README file with a paragraph explaining your process, the directives you used, and why.

5. BONUS: Use the ng-router directive, pulled in using npm.

NOTE: use the contacts.json file in the public folder to populate the Address Book.
